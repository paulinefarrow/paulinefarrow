# Given a Minesweeper-like grid represented by a list of lists. 
# The grid contains two types of cells: "-" for free spots and "#" for mines. 
# Your task is to create a function that takes this grid as input 
# and returns a copy of the grid where each "-" is replaced with a 
# number representing the count of mines in the surrounding cells 
# (including diagonals).



# output_grid = minesweeper(input_grid)

# The resulting output_grid should be:
